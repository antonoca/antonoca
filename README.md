## Hi there 👋
I'm antonoca, also known as Cristian. I'm a 16 year old (almost 17!) Italian guy which made various projects.

## My projects 👨‍💻
- I started with Zuzuku, a customized mod of the yuzu emulator, which was developed for fun by some of my friends and me.

- I'm currently developing Winlator@Omod, which is a fork of Winlator, an app that lets you run Windows applications on Android via box64 and wine that adds various things such as a customized prefix, different dx wrapper versions and different turnip versions.

That is my overall best project that I made solo from zero, and I'm honestly very proud of it!

## My programming languages 🔗
- I'm mostly a Python developer, but i also know a little bit of html and javascript.
I develop software for fun and not in a serious way, you should start too!

aaand thats all, still, thanks for reading
have a great day!
